How to run the program
This project shows us how to find 3-character passwords, displaying an exponential graph at the end showing the time taken to crack the password and its length.
1. You must ensure that you have the Python extension installed.
2. Similarly, check whether you have installed the libraries used in the program.
   " command to install "
   pip install matplotlib numpy
3. To execute the program put "python bruteforce.py"
   To start using the program you need to put a password of 3 characters
   FOR EXAMPLE:
   "M9/"
   The console will show:
   Contrase√±a encontrada: M9/
  Intentos realizados: 109318
  Tiempo transcurrido: 0.0493 segundos
Then also a graphic will appear, showing us a line that indicates the time and the lenght of each character of the password.
REFLECTION:
If the password contains more than 8 characters, the combinations no find it will increase, in the program we can only see password of 3 character but if you want to see a password of 8 characters maybe the time of execution and also de graphic would look bigger.
